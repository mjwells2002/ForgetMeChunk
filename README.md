# ForgetMeChunk

ForgetMeChunk is a simple client side mod that prevents light map unloads on the client, 
this eliminates the fps drops caused by crossing certain chunk borders

However **this casues a memory leak**, this memory leak is reset by changing dimension or leaving the server/world,
**So use at your own risk**
